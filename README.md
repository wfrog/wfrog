**wfrog** is a web-based weather station software with nice charts and many ways to publish them on the web, and much more...

The architecture is meant to be very easy to add support for other weather station models and allow for rendering the weather data in several formats and medias using an extensible renderer structure.

The processing and memory footprint of wfrog is very low, making it suitable to run on low-power equipment like PC-engine Alix, Cisco NLSU2 or SheevaPlug.
